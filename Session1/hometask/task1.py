# Exercise 1. Basic Arithmetic Operations 
# Write a program that takes two integers from the 
# user and prints the result of addition, subtractiom, multipliation,and division of these two numbers 

# num = int(input("Please provide a number : "))
# num2 = int (input("Please provide a second number : "))
# print( num + num2 )
# print( num - num2 )
# print( num * num2 )
# print( num / num2 )

# Task 2 . 

# Given the string sentence = " Python programminf is fun!"
# Print the substing " programing " using sliccing. 
# Print every 2nd charachter from the string 
# Reverse the string and print it.

# word= "Pythin programing is fun !"
# print(word[6:18])
# print(word[::2])
# print(word[::-1])

# Task 3. 

# Take two strings as input: first name and last name. 
# Concatenate  them with a space in between and print the full name.
# Print the full name in all uppercase letters.

# first = "Elsu"
# last = "Loda"
# print(first.upper(),last.upper(), end='\n', sep=' has her granfathers last name with is ')

# Task 4. 
# Ask the user ti input a sentence, then print the length of that sentence (number of characrters )

# sen = input(" Please provide a sentence: ")
# print(len(sen))

# Task 5 
# Take two integers as input.
# Print the results of integer division (//).
# Print the remainder using modulus operator.

# int1 = int(input("Please provide number: "))
# int2 = int(input("Please provide number 2: "))
# print( int1//int2)
# print ( int1%int2)

# Task 6
# Write a program to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
# Formula: F = ( C*9/5)+32 
# Take input temperature in Celsius ans output the temperature in Farenheir. 

# cel = float(input(" Please provide celsius: "))
# print((cel*9/5)+32)

# Task 7 
# Take two integers, base and exponent, as input 
# Print the results of base raised to the power of exponent (**)
# Print the modulus of base by expondent (%) 
 
# base = int(input("Please provide base: ")) 
# exponent = int(input("Please provide base : ") )
# print(base**exponent)
# print(base%exponent)
